## R1D002 - February 5, Tuesday, 2020

## R1D003 - February 6, Tuesday, 2020

- Made some progress on latex-toolkit. Mostly building the base for the CLI functionality.
- Until now all the code was written [test-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) as much as possible.
- Learned a lot about Yeoman, Yargs and InquirerJS.
- Gonna build some configurable templates tomorrow.

## R1D004 - February 7, Tuesday, 2020

- I have created a package for all my @yeoman generators and templates. Will save me a lot of time future.
- First time I tried a Pomodoro-based time tracker app. Turned out this is indeed a great way to stay focused. Didn't get lost in the rabbit hole today.
- Tomorrow I will concentrate much more on the actual cli code. Infrastructure setup is finally completed ðŸ¤–

## R1D005 - February 8, Tuesday, 2020

- Got lost in improving the infrastructure and build tools again. Too much automation. I guess my code doesn't need me anymore ðŸ˜€
- I also added a first actual template and the required copying logic. That part was quite tricky but I got it working ðŸŽ‰
