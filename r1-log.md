## R1D002 - February 5, Tuesday, 2020

## R1D003 - February 6, Tuesday, 2020

- Made some progress on latex-toolkit. Mostly building the base for the CLI functionality.
- Until now all the code was written [test-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) as much as possible.
- Learned a lot about Yeoman, Yargs and InquirerJS.
- Gonna build some configurable templates tomorrow.

## R1D004 - February 7, Tuesday, 2020

- I have created a package for all my @yeoman generators and templates. Will save me a lot of time future.
- First time I tried a Pomodoro-based time tracker app. Turned out this is indeed a great way to stay focused. Didn't get lost in the rabbit hole today.
- Tomorrow I will concentrate much more on the actual cli code. Infrastructure setup is finally completed ü§ñ

## R1D005 - February 8, Tuesday, 2020

- Got lost in improving the infrastructure and build tools again. Too much automation. I guess my code doesn't need me anymore üòÄ
- I also added a first actual template and the required copying logic. That part was quite tricky but I got it working üéâ

## R1D006 - February 9, Tuesday, 2020

- Had to meet an important deadline today so couldn't get much done here ‚è±Ô∏è
- Nevertheless I worked a small night shift to add a master generator which can be used as a launcher for all available @yeoman subgenerators
- All subgenerators are presented as an interactive list which the user can choose one generator from
- The chosen generator is started as a subprocess afterwards
- Now the user doesn't have to know which generators are included and can easily select one from a nice list üßí

## R1D007 - February 10, Tuesday, 2020

- Another late shift today üåô
- But I finally have some running code to show, see GIF in linked tweet below.
- This is generating a starter template for developing a Docker image with an automated build and release setup.

## R1D008 - February 11, Tuesday, 2020

- Nothing spectacular new today.
- Fought some config files for hours üëø CircleCI didn't like me today.
- Finally my generator truly generates a new project. Including a brand new GitHub repository and a CircleCI project.

## R1D009 - February 12, Tuesday, 2020

- Played around a lot with @Docker and @gatsbyjs today.
- Used my template generator to publish a small utility Docker image for building GatsbyJS projects in a CI.
- Template generator works great. It doesn't even take a minute until a new OpenSource project is setup including CI/CD.

- Learned some new things about TypeScript generics while doing that.

## R1D012- February 15, Tuesday, 2020

- Did not have as much time today as planned.
- Created another template for #nodejs libraries and applications.
